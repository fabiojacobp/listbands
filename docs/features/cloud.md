You can access all of your content on the internet by setting up a static website for the manager. This will enable you or your team to edit your content from anywhere with a connection to the internet. To access the manager you first need to login and supply some configuration settings. This can be done at the `/login` endpoint. These settings can be saved so they need to be entered in only once.

Once logged in, the manager provides a simple interface to your documents.
