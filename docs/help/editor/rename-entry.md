You can rename an entry directly by opening it and editing either the `title`, `folder` or `slug`. The title is used is various areas of the front end template. It is used as the `title` tag in the `HTML`.

```html
<title>{{title}}</title>
```

It is used for the content title on the entry, as well as for the breadcrumbs and menu. Editing this value will change it in all locations. Editing the `folder` or `slug` will change the location (`url`) of the entry. This will break any bookmarks and/or any links directed to the page.

You can also right click on the entry you would like to rename and select the "Rename" option.
